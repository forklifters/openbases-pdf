This is an automated build for a Docker container to build you a paper! 
If you want to use the builder for your repository, you can read full
instructions at [openbases/builder-pdf](https://www.github.com/openbases/builder-pdf).

## Development

Build the container locally. See [openbases/builder-pdf](https://www.github.com/openbases/builder-pdf)
for usage.

```bash
docker build -t openbases/openbases-pdf .
```
